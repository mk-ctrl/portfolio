export const aboutMe = `Hi! I’m a passionate and curious developer with a love for building innovative, user-friendly solutions. Whether I’m working on web apps, diving into machine learning, or exploring new technologies, I’m always driven by a desire to learn and create meaningful impact.

I specialize in full-stack development, combining strong frontend skills with backend expertise. Over time, I’ve built projects ranging from interactive quiz apps and recommendation systems to AI-powered tools — and I’m always eager to take on new challenges.

Beyond coding, I enjoy participating in hackathons, contributing to team projects, and constantly sharpening my problem-solving skills. I believe great products come from a mix of creativity, technical skill, and a deep understanding of user needs.

Let’s connect — I’m excited to collaborate, learn, and grow together!
